# The R package ARTP3
This package offers a set of pathway analysis procedures designed to assess associations between outcomes and groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within biological pathways. Building on existing P-value combining methods, it introduces a flexible approach using an adaptive rank truncated product statistic to combine evidence across SNPs and genes. Statistical significance is evaluated via an efficient permutation algorithm that scales with pathway size and complexity. The package supports GWAS summary data from single or multi-ancestry populations and offers SNP-centric or gene-centric strategies for multi-ancestry analyses.
